    <h3> Happy hour is Monday thru Friday until 6pm, featuring 2-for-1 wine, beer and well drinks.</h3>
    <h2> Wine, Beer & Spirits </h2>
    <p> Our wine list is constantly changing, but always features 70+ hand-picked wines from around the world with emphasis on Spain, Italy, France and and the U.S. The wines are chosen for value, diversity, and uniqueness. There's everything from bold California Cabs, Italian Super-Tuscans, and New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc to out of the way gems like spritzy Vinho Verde, brut Burgundian Chardonnay, and dry Spanish Moscatel, to French classics like Sancerre and Cotes Du Rhone. 
    <p>Our by-the-glass list changes nightly and we will generally open any wine at all if you take two glasses. We then put the remainder of the bottle on the by-the glass list imediately. So if you are knowledgeable about wines or just into trying new things, you can shape the by-the-glass list with your choices and give others the chance to try something interesting and different.
    <p>Our vibe and service are casual, but focused on creating the best tasting experience possible. We generally dispense with elaborate wine presentation rituals, and concentrate on serving each wine with appropriate aeration, at the right temperature, and in good stemware. By-the-glass wine is served in quartino decanters, so you get a generous pour without overfilling the glass, leaving you that all-important swirl-room.
    <p>Wine is kind of our thing, but we also love beer. We've got four great ones on tap, including the celebrated Delerium Tremens from Belgium, and a fun selection of American craft-beers and European ales. And, hey, we're all about relaxation and fun, so if you want a cocktail, or a nice single-malt scotch, we do that, too. Come enjoy some great food, and wines, beers and spirits from around the world.

      <h2>SALUMI TAPAS &amp; WINE BAR</h2>
      <h3>5600 Merric Road, Massapequa, NY</h3>
      <p>Across from Best Yet super market.</p>
      <h3>Open 7 days 4pm to Midnight for dinner, drinks and snacking.</h3>
      <h3>Open for Lunch Monday thru Friday at 11:30.</h3>
      <br>
      <h3>1-516-620-0057. Email: SalumiBar@gmail.com.</h3>

      <p>Salumi Tapas and Wine Bar, opened its doors Friday, April 18th.  
      As you enter, you see the massive 32 foot antique timber bar with
      seating for 18 and the dark ceiling beams overhead. The atmosphere is warm 
      and rustic with tons of reclaimed wood and brick, and even the 
      barn-board booths, bistro tables and leather banquettes are 
      custom made from gorgeous old board and timber.

      <p>The menu features a variety of interesting small plates of 
      Spanish and Italian origin from polenta with truffled mushrooms 
      to Catalan-style short-rib and chorizo and beet-orange salad, as 
      well as a wide selection of artfully composed cheese and cured 
      meat boards with fruits and nuts. The wine list is ecclectic and 
      value-driven with over 70 hand-picked wines from across Europe 
      and the New World, many by the glass, and craft beers on tap 
      and in the bottle. There is also a full bar.

      <p>The vibe is hip, foody, and casual - the food, wine, and beer is 
      gourmet, but the attitude is laid back. The music is as eclectic 
      as the wine list, with everything from Flamenco and old jazz to 
      rhythm and blues and bluegrass guitar.  This is a place to eat 
      fun, sophisticated food and drink great wine in your hippest gear 
      or just a black T-shirt and jeans. The point is relaxation, fun, 
      and a new experience with every visit.
